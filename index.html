				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<img id="bio-image" src="assets/images/image.jpg" alt="Your Name" style="width: 250px; height: 200px;">
		

		
				<p>I’ve recently completed Trilogy’s six month software development boot camp; supported through the University of Utah. Though I'm relatively new on this career path, I was inspired to walk it by my significant other, and feel very passionate about the profession. I genuinely enjoy this type of work because of the opportunity to apply logic and problem solving skills in overcoming the various obstacles that present themselves in a personal and professional environment. Nothing drives me more mad than debugging but in the end it’s also the most satisfying.

				When I entered high school I was so far ahead that I probably could have graduated early.  One of my life defining moments was my senior year when I found out that I was not going to graduate. I was a number of credits shy of my diploma, but my life had been slowly turned upside down over the years.  Unable to handle the stress of various impactful events, I had given up completely. When I learned that I wasn't going to graduate I had never felt like such a failure.  It was a pivotal moment in my life; I knew I had to do something. Unsatisfied with the prospect of a GED, I enrolled in an adult high school and I finished the remaining credits. Not long after I got my diploma, I enrolled in the bootcamp to start with renewed spirit in the world. The only place for failure in my life is as a stepping stone; I stopped moving in high school and it nearly destroyed me, I won’t let anything stop me again.</p>
