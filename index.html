				<p>Hi, My name is Jeannie Root, I am 21 years old. I just completed a six month software development boot camp program by the company Trilogy and supported through the University of Utah. I haven't been into this very long, just a little longer than the bootcamp course. I decided to get into this career mainly because my significant other is a senior devops engineer and has been encouraging me to start a career of my own and it seemed like a good idea to get into the same field as him. I really enjoy this type of work, I love using logic and being able to overcome all the obstacles that present themselves. Nothing drives me more mad than debugging but it also makes me feel the most satisfied by the end. I like long walks, music, crocheting, horses, reading, as well as many other things. One of my defining moments that has made me who I am was probably my senior year of high school when I found out I wasn't going to graduate. I was 2.75 credits shy of my diploma. A lot of stressful things had been impacting me for the last couple of years and by that point I had given up. When I learned that I wasn't going to graduate I had never felt like such a failure in my life. When I entered high school I was ahead and probably could have graduated early. My whole life had turned around. After that I knew I had to do something. I couldn't keep going that way. I could have gone and gotten my GED easy but I wouldn't be satisfied with that, I enrolled in an adult hight school and I finished those 2.75 credits. I wouldn't be satisfied with any less. Not long after I got my diploma, I enrolled in the bootcamp and finished that too. I stopped moving in high school and it nearly destroyed me. I don't plan on stopping again. The only place for failure in my life is as a stepping stone. I won't take any less than success.</p>
